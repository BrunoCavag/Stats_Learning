    "Testing Machine Learning projects is challenging. Training a model is a long-running task that may take hours to run and has a non-deterministic output, which is the opposite we need to test software: quick and deterministic procedures.\n",

    "**What can go wrong?**\n",

    "To motivate our testing strategy, let’s enumerate what could go wrong with each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature generation pipeline\n",
    "- Cannot run the pipeline (e.g., setup problems, broken code).\n",
    "- Cannot reproduce a previously generated training set.\n",
    "- Pipeline produces low-quality training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training task\n",
    "- Cannot train a model (e.g., missing dependencies, broken code).\n",
    "- Running the training task with high-quality data produces low-quality models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model file\n",
    "- The generated model has a lower quality than our current model in production.\n",
    "- The model file does not integrate correctly with the serving pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serving pipeline\n",
    "- Cannot serve predictions (e.g., missing dependencies, broken code).\n",
    "- Mismatch between preprocessing at training and serving time (aka training-serving skew).\n",
    "- Outputs a prediction when passing invalid raw data.\n",
    "- Crashes when passed valid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoke testing. We ensure our code works by running it on each git push.\n",
    "- Integration testing and unit testing. Test task’s output and data transformations.\n",
    "- Distribution changes and serving pipeline. Test changes in data distributions and test we can load a model file and predict.\n",
    "- Training-serving skew. Test that the training and serving logic is consistent.\n",
    "Model quality. Test model quality."
